# Project-Miro

#### This is an abandoned javascript discord bot project. I had its code so thought to make it opensource. It uses quick.db which is based on SQL. There might be many bugs in it and the music system is not complete.

### I might work on this project in future and make it active.
### For support join [CTK's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Qu5BJmehYS) (Note: It is not my server, it is a server where i help people to fix there problems in coding.) or open a issue and i will fix it as soon as possible.
### And if you know how to fix a flaw just open a pull request.
