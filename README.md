# Project-Miro

#### This is an abandoned discord bot project. I had its code so thought to make it opensource. It uses quick.db which is based on SQL. 

## I might work on this project in future and make it active.
## For support join [CTK's Server](www.withwin.in/dbd) or open a issue and i will fix it as soon as possible.
## And if you know how to fix a flaw just open a pull request.
